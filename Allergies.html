		<p>An allergy is where your body reacts to something that's normally harmless like pollen, dust or animal fur. The symptoms can be mild, but for some people they can be very serious.</p>
		<p>Allergy occurs when a person`s immune system reacts to substances in the environment that do not bother most people. These substances are known as allergens and are found in house dust mites, pets, pollen, moulds and foods.</p>
		<p>Allergies are reactions that a person's body gives from allergens getting in contact with antibodies that are present in the body. </p>
		<p>Allergens can be found commonly in:</p>
		<li>dust mites</li>
		<li>pets</li>
		<li>pollen</li>
		<li>ticks</li>
		<li>insects</li>
		<li>moulds</li>
		<li>foods</li>
		<li>medications</li>
		<p>When both allergens and antibodies get in contact it can cause some slight or aggressive immune inflammation.</p>
		<p>Immune inflammations usually occur in the :</p>
		<li>nose and/or eyes</li>
		<li>skin,and lungs</li>

		<header><h2>Treatment for Allergy</h2></header>
		<p>Treatments for allergies include:</p>
		<li>trying to avoid the thing you're allergic to whenever possible.</li>
		<li>medicines for mild allergic reactions like antihistamines, steroid tablets and steroid creams.</li>
		<li>emergency medicines called adrenaline auto-injectors, such as an EpiPen, for severe allergic reactions.</li>
		<li>desensitisation (immunotherapy) for severe allergic reactions â€“ this involves carefully exposing you to the thing you're allergic to over time, so your body gradually gets used to it and does not react so badly (this should only be done by a medical professional).</li>
