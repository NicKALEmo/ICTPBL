				<p>What is HIV?</p>
		<p>HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that attacks the body's immune system. If HIV is not treated, it can lead to AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome).</p>
		<p>There is currently no effective cure. Once people get HIV, they have it for life.</p>
		<p>But with proper medical care, HIV can be controlled. People with HIV who get effective HIV treatment can live long, healthy lives and protect their partners.</p>
		<p>HIV is caused by a virus. It can spread through sexual contact, illicit injection drug use or sharing needles, contact with infected blood, or from mother to child during pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding. HIV destroys CD4 T cells â€” white blood cells that play a large role in helping your body fight disease.</p>
		<header><h2>Possible symptoms for HIV/ADIS</h2></header>
		<li>Fever.</li>
		<li>Chills.</li>
		<li>Rash.</li>
		<li>Night sweats.</li>
		<li>Muscle aches.</li>
		<li>Sore throat.</li>

		<header><h2>Treatment for HIV/AIDS</h2></header>
		<p>The classes of anti- HIV drugs include: Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) turn off a protein needed by HIV to make copies of itself. Examples include efavirenz (Sustiva), rilpivirine (Edurant) and doravirine (Pifeltro).</p>
		<p>But if you have HIV and take ART drugs, the virus still lives inside a group of cells called the HIV reservoir. If you stop taking ART, the virus in the reservoir can spike again. Right now, there's still no complete cure for HIV infection.</p>
		<p>There are two types of HIV treatment: pills and shots.</p>
		<li>Pills are recommended for people who are just starting HIV treatment.</li>
		<li>People who have had an undetectable viral load (or have been virally suppressed) for at least three months may consider shots.
